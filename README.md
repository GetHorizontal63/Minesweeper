# Minesweeper
An evolutionary Minesweeper solver that learns optimal strategies through natural selection. Agents evolve by playing thousands of games with increasing difficulty. The system uses constraint solving, pattern matching, and combines tournament selection with adaptive mutation to discover optimal decision parameters.
